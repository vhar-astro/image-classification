## Technical Highlights

### YOLO Format Implementation
- Normalized coordinates (0.0 to 1.0 range)
- Format: `<class_id> <x_center> <y_center> <width> <height>`
- Center-point based (not top-left corner)
- Compatible with standard YOLO training pipelines

### Coordinate System Management
- Three coordinate spaces handled:
  1. **Screen coordinates**: Pixel positions on display
  2. **Image coordinates**: Pixel positions in original image
  3. **Normalized coordinates**: YOLO format (0-1 range)
- Automatic transformation between spaces
- Handles image scaling and window resizing correctly

### Interactive Drawing Features
- Click and drag to create boxes
- Visual feedback during drawing (dashed outline)
- Label selection dialog after drawing
- Select boxes by clicking
- Resize by dragging corner handles
- Delete with keyboard (Delete/Backspace) or button
- Color-coded boxes for easy identification
- Label display above each box

### Non-Destructive Workflow
- Original images are copied, never moved
- Annotations saved separately from images
- Easy to re-annotate or modify
- Source images remain untouched

### User Experience Enhancements
- Progress tracking with percentage and counts
- Image information display (filename, dimensions, size)
- Box list showing all annotations
- Auto-save on navigation
- Unsaved changes warning
- Keyboard shortcuts (Delete key)
- Responsive UI with proper enable/disable states
